## About
The goal of the CHoRUS Network is to develop the most diverse, high-resolution, ethically sourced, AI-ready data set to answer the grand challenge of improving recovery from acute illness.
<br/>
This collaboration spans 20 academic centers, of which 14 will contribute as Data Acquisition centers.
<br/>
Patient-focused efforts will determine the ethical and legal approaches to manage privacy and bias, while accounting for Social Determinants of Health.
<br/>
Unified standards will harmonize multi-modal EHR, waveform, imaging, and text data.
<br/>
A visualization and annotation environment will label data with targets important for prediction.
<br/>
A comprehensive set of approaches will develop the skills and workforce for a next generation of diverse academic and community AI scientists.
<br/>
Federated access will enable sampling methods to ensure a balanced and diverse cohort.
<br/>
Collaborating with Bridge2AI and 3 other data generation projects, the CHoRUS Network will help us cross the Bridge2AI network together.
